# The Island - Computer Graphics 
This directory refers to the project 'The Island' which was the final project of the Computer Graphics course, which is part of the BS in Computer Science program at University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP, ICMC).

The project aimed to apply the knowledge learned through the course by creating an island's landscape.
The island landscape contains an island, surrounded by the ocean, with some coconut trees, a boat, some barrels and other cool objects. The water movement was based on the Tessendorf's research[1].
